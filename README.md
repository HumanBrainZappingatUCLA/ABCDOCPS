The scripts in this repository were used in the production of our manuscript, currently titled, 
"Hormonal contraceptive intake during adolescence and cortical brain measures in the ABCD Study."

figure_generation_cohens.R and figure_generation_correlation.R were written by Brian Boss√©.

abcd_hormone_cleaning_and_analysis.ipynb, abcd_ocp_covariates.ipynb, and ocps_wholebrain_multiplemodels.ipynb were written by Nicole Petersen. Importantly,
the data frames in all three scripts were conceptualized and constructed by Elvisha Dhamala, and these were integral to subsequent analyses.

abcd_hormone_cleaning_and_analysis.ipynb also contains code adapted from scripts written by Katie Bottenhorn to filter and clean ABCD hormone data. 
Dr Bottenhorn's code was adapted from R to python for this analysis.

Errors should be attributed to Nicole Petersen. Questions or error reports can be sent to npetersen@ucla.edu.
